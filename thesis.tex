% This template is mostly a simplified and rearranged version of ClassicThesis v4.6
% https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis
% You are encouraged to check out ClassicThesisManual.pdf

% Besides simplifications, some slight adjustments were made to fulfill the University of Toronto School of Graduate Studies style requirements. It also includes some adjustments for better integration with the ams packages and for letter sized paper.


% The following four lines are necessary due to compatibility issues. They are suppressing some errors.
\RequirePackage{silence}
\WarningFilter{scrreprt}{Usage of package `titlesec'}
\WarningFilter{scrreprt}{Activating an ugly workaround}
\WarningFilter{titlesec}{Non standard sectioning command}

% You can run this document two ways.

% Option 1: Same margins on both sides and no "open right"
% This is the best option for the digital version of your thesis.
