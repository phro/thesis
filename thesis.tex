% This template is mostly a simplified and rearranged version of ClassicThesis v4.6
% https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis
% You are encouraged to check out ClassicThesisManual.pdf

% Besides simplifications, some slight adjustments were made to fulfill the University of Toronto School of Graduate Studies style requirements. It also includes some adjustments for better integration with the ams packages and for letter sized paper.


% The following four lines are necessary due to compatibility issues. They are suppressing some errors.
\RequirePackage{silence}
\WarningFilter{scrreprt}{Usage of package `titlesec'}
\WarningFilter{scrreprt}{Activating an ugly workaround}
\WarningFilter{titlesec}{Non standard sectioning command}

% You can run this document two ways.

% Option 1: Same margins on both sides and no "open right"
% This is the best option for the digital version of your thesis.
\documentclass[oneside,numbers=noenddot,headinclude,footinclude,cleardoublepage=empty,abstract=on,BCOR=5mm,paper=letter,fontsize=11pt]{scrreprt}

% Option 2: When you print your thesis, comment the above documentclass and uncomment the one below.
% The only difference is ``twoside'' instead of ``oneside''
% That way, the outer margins are larger than the inner margins. Also, chapters are always opened on the right hand side.
% This results in a MUCH nicer printed version. No worries, all page breaks remain where they are, it just moves everything to the left or right a bit.
% ALSO: Make sure to uncomment the addmargin environments in titlepage.tex and colophon.tex. That way, the first and last page remain centered
%\documentclass[twoside,numbers=noenddot,headinclude,footinclude,cleardoublepage=empty,abstract=on,BCOR=5mm,paper=letter,fontsize=11pt]{scrreprt}

% So to recap: Typeset your whole thesis with Option 1 and submit the resulting version electronically
% But before actually printing the thesis, rerun the document with Option 2.

% Any packages, newcommands, ... should be put in the thesisconfig file.
