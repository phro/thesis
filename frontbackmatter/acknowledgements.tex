\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Thank you:

To my advisor, Dror Bar-Natan, whose consistent meetings, guidance, and
encouragement brought me to this point, and to my supervisory committee, Joel
Kamnitzer and Eckhard Meinrenken, for their feedback and for helping me connect
to more of the department and its research.

To Jason Siefken and the other teaching mentors in the math department: you have
made me a better educator and communicator.

To the math department administration, especially Jemima Merisca and Sonja
Injac, whose kindness made the department a comfortable place to be.

To Assaf Bar-Natan, Vincent Girard, Caleb Jonker, and Adriano Pacifico, whose
friendship, bike trips, and cooking sessions provided much joy; to the people I
met in the department, especially those who opened my thesis to confirm they
were included here: thank you specifically.

To the care-taking staff at the St.\@ George campus, especially Maria and Maria,
whose diligent work and kind words have made this campus beautiful.

To the U of T Graduate Christian Fellowship for providing a refreshing breadth
of conversation and companionship.

To Rosemary and Alan Johnstone, whose hospitality made me feel immediately
welcome in a new city.

To my family, who encouraged me in my academic pursuits from the start: to my
mom for embracing my atypical learning styles, for instilling my love of
reading, and for teaching my how to think deeply; to my dad for teaching me to
cycle, cook, and notice the invisible among us; and to my brother for all the
laughter you bring to my life.

To the Perrins: you are my second family, and your support and love for me is
precious.

To my wife, Emily Langridge, who helped me with the motivation to finish. I look
forward to the next chapters of my life with you.
