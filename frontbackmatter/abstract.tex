A well-known source of strong link invariants comes from quantum groups.
Typically, one uses a representation of a quantum group to build a computable
invariant, though these computations require exponential time in the number of
crossings. Recent work has allowed for direct and efficient computations within
the quantum groups themselves, through the use of perturbed Gaussian
differential operators. This thesis introduces and explores a partial expansion
of the tangle-theoretic computations performed by Bar-Natan and van der Veen
\cite{BV} in the quantum group $\uea{\Sl_{2+}^0}$ to its space of coinvariants,
providing an extension of this computational method from open tangles to links.
After writing a program to compute the invariant on two-component links, we
found unexpectedly that this extension is neither stronger nor weaker than the
\acl{MVA}.
