\label{ch:intro}

\section{Tensor product notation}
In what follows, we will extensively use tensor products, tensor powers, and
generalizations thereof. We begin by introducing the notation that will be used
first for traditional tensor products, then for their generalizations.

Let $V$ be a $\K$-vector space (for the moment assumed to be finite
dimensional). When working with a large tensor power $V^{\otimes n}$ of $V$, it
will often be more convenient to label tensor factors with elements of a finite
set $S$ (with $\ord S = n$) rather than by their position in a linear order.

For example, consider the vector $u \otimes v \otimes w \in V^{\otimes 3}$. Let
us choose an index set $S = \set{1,2,3}$. We then may equivalently write this
vector by labelling each tensor factor with one of the elements of $S$, say
$u_1v_2w_3$. Since the labels serve to distinguish the separate factors, this
vector may equivalently be written as $u_1v_2w_3 = v_2u_1w_3 = w_3u_2u_1 \in
V^{\otimes S}$. We will write the set $V^{\otimes S}$ with a subscript: $V_S$.
We formalize the idea below:

\begin{definition}[indexed tensor powers]
        Let $V$ be a vector space and $S = \set{s_1,…, s_n}$ be a finite
        set. We define the \defi{indexed tensor power} of $V$ to be the
        collection of formal linear combinations of functions from $S$ to $V$
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:indexed_tensor}
                V_S \defeq \Span\set{\map {f} {S} {V}}/\sim
        \end{equation}
        subject to the standard multilinear relations, namely multi-additivity
        and the factoring of scalars.

        By multi-additivity, we mean that for each $i\in S$ and $f, g \in V_S$ satisfying
        $f(i) = g(i) = v$, we have:
        \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:tensor_additive}
                f + g = \pn*{
                        s \mapsto \begin{cases}
                                v & \text{if $s = i$}\\
                                f(i) + g(i) & \text{otherwise}
                        \end{cases}
                }
        \end{equation}
\end{definition}

In practice, we will write such functions $\map {f} {S} {V}$ with $f(s_i) = v_i$
in the following way:
\begin{equation}
        \pn{v_{1}}_{s_1}
        \pn{v_{2}}_{s_2} ⋯
        \pn{v_{n}}_{s_n}
        \defeq f
\end{equation}
With this notation, we may easily express the factoring of scalars as:
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:tensor_scalar}
        (v_1)_{s_1}(v_2)_{s_2} ⋯(λv_i)_{s_i} ⋯(v_n)_{s_n} = 
        λ\cdot(v_1)_{s_1}(v_2)_{s_2} ⋯(v_n)_{s_n}
\end{equation}

Next, we introduce notation for maps between tensor powers so that we may
unambiguously refer to appropriate tensor factors while defining morphisms. Let
$D$ and $C$ be finite sets, and $\map {T} {V_{D}} {V_{C}}$. We will denote $T$
by $T^{D}_{C}$. It is important to note that when $T$ is not symmetric in its
arguments, the order of the indices in this notation matters.

\begin{example}
        Let $V = \R^2$, and $T^{a, b}_{c}$ defined by
        \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                        T^{a, b}_{c}\pn*{\vec v_a(\vec e_1)_b} &= \vec 0_c\\
                        T^{a, b}_{c}\pn*{\vec v_a(\vec e_2)_b} &= \vec v_c
                \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        This function zeros out vectors whose $b$-component is $\vec e_1$. If we
        wish to define an analogous function for the $a$-component, we may
        simply reverse the order of the superscript: $T^{b, a}_{c}$, which sends
        $\vec v_b(\vec e_1)_a = (\vec e_1)_a\vec v_b$ to $\vec 0_c$ and
        $\vec v_b(\vec e_2)_a$ to $\vec v_c$.
\end{example}

Finally, we point out that any morphism $T^D_C$ may be extended to one with
larger domain and codomain. We introduce the notation
$T^{D}_{C}[S] \defeq T^D_C \otimes \Id{S}$ for this concept, though will also
overload the notation $T^D_C$ for the same map: for any $v_D \in V_{D}$ and
$w_S\in V_{S}$, we may also write
$\pn*{T^{D}_{C}}\pn{v_{D}\otimes w_S} \defeq \pn*{T^{D}_{C}v_{D}}\otimes w_S$.

\begin{remark}
There are three special cases with this notation:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Given a (multi)linear functional
                $\map {ϕ} {V_{S}} {\K \iso V_{\emptyset}}$, we will write $ϕ^S$
                instead of $ϕ^S_{\emptyset}$. The linear order on $S$ remains in
                this notation.
        \item Elements $v\in V_{S}$ will be interpreted as a map
                $\map {v} {\K = V_{\emptyset}} {V_S}$ written $v_S$ instead of
                $v^{\emptyset}_{S}$.
        \item When only one index is present in a subscript or superscript, and
                its omission does not introduce an ambiguity in an expression,
                then it may be omitted to improve readability. For instance, a
                map $\map {ϕ} {V_{\set{1,2}}} {V_{\set{3}}}$ may
                be written as $ϕ^{1,2}$ instead of $ϕ^{1,2}_{3}$, with the
                canonical isomorphism $V\iso V_{\set{3}}$ being suppressed.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

When taking the tensor product of two such tensor powers, we follow \cite{BS}
and use the notation \enquote{$\sqcup$} instead of \enquote{$\otimes$}:
\begin{equation}
        V_{X} \sqcup V_{Y} \defeq V_{X \sqcup Y}
\end{equation}
Additionally, given $ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}$ and $ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}$ such that $D_1 \cap D_2 = \emptyset = C_1
\cap C_2$, we have a product morphism
$\map {ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}ψ^{D_2}_{C_2} \defeq ϕ \otimes ψ} {V_{D_1 \sqcup D_2}}
{V_{C_1\sqcup C_2}}$, which we also write with concatenation.

\section{Meta-objects}\label{sec:meta-objects}

\subsection{Notation extension beyond vector spaces}
\label{sec:monoidal_notation}

\ProvideDocumentCommand{\CC}{}{\msc C}
\ProvideDocumentCommand{\MM}{}{A}

While the above notation is helpful when working with vector spaces, we are
interested in also using the same notation to describe a tangle. Our
formulation of tangles (introduced in
\cref{sec:topological_interpretations}) is neither a tensor product nor a
monoidal category, though it shares many similarities with both concepts. In
particular, the domains and codomains of the maps we have discussed so far have
only depended on the index set. With this observation, we replace the notation of
tensor powers with that of a so-called meta-object:

\begin{definition}[Meta-object]
        Let $\CC$ be a category. A \defi{meta-object} in $\CC$ is subcategory
        with objects indexed by the functor
        \begin{equation}
                \mapdef {\MM} {\FinSet} {\Object(\CC)}
                              {S}       {\MM_S}
        \end{equation}
        The homsets of this subcategory are indexed by pairs of finite sets $D$,
        $C$. Morphisms in these homsets will be denoted by
        $\map{ϕ^D_C}{\MM_D}{\MM_C}$.
        For each such morphism $ϕ^{D}_{C}$, there is a finite-set-indexed
        morphism $\map {ϕ^{D}_{C}[\curry{}]} {\FinSet} {\HomOp(\CC)}$
        such that 
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item $\map {ϕ[\curry{S}]}{\MM_{C\sqcup S}} {\MM_{D\sqcup S}}$
                \item $ϕ[\emptyset] = ϕ$
                \item $\pn*{ϕ[S]}[T] = ϕ[S \sqcup T]$
        \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Note that the functor generalizes the map $S \mapsto V^{\otimes S}$, while the
morphisms generalize the extension-by-identity $ϕ \otimes \Id{S}$.

Composition of morphisms $ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}$ and $ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}$ is defined when
$C_1 = D_2$, and is written with the following concatenation operator:
\footnote{
        We denote left-to-right composition with the \enquote{$\then$} symbol:
        $f \then g \defeq g \circ f$. Writing function composition in this order
        assists with readability when there are many functions to apply.
}
\begin{equation}
        \map{
                ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}\then ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}
                \defeq
                ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}\circ ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}
        }{\msc C_{D_1}}{\CC_{C_2}}
\end{equation}

In the general case, we still have the map
$\sqcup$ defined by $\MM_{S} \sqcup \MM_{T} = \MM_{S \sqcup T}$. Given morphisms
$ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}$ and $ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}$ such that $D_1 \cap D_2 = \emptyset = C_1
\cap C_2$, we have a product morphism
$\map {ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}ψ^{D_2}_{C_2} \defeq ϕ \otimes ψ} {\CC_{D_1 \sqcup D_2}}
{\CC_{C_1\sqcup C_2}}$, which we write with concatenation.

\begin{remark}
        To make expressions easier to read, in this paper we
        will introduce the domain extension implicitly in the following context:
        given morphisms $ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}$ and $ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}$ such that
        $D_2 \subseteq C_1$ and
        $C_2 \cap (C_1\setminus D_2)=\emptyset=D_1\cap(D_2 \setminus C_1)$, we
        define:
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:composition_extension}
                ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1} \then ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}
                \defeq 
                {ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}[D_2\setminus C_1]} \then
                {ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}[C_1\setminus D_2]}
        \end{equation}
\end{remark}
The two extreme cases of this definition are:
\begin{itemize}
        \item When $C_1 \cap D_2 = \emptyset$, \cref{eq:composition_extension}
                becomes $ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}$. 
        \item When $C_1 = D_2$, \cref{eq:composition_extension} becomes the
                composition $ϕ^{D_1}_{C_1}\then ψ^{D_2}_{C_2}$ exactly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
        While the $\then$ operator is associative, care must be taken that the
        compositions are well-defined in the presence of duplicated indices.
        While it is sufficient for all the finite sets in a composition to be
        pairwise disjoint, this condition will prove too restrictive for clear
        communication of formulae.
\end{remark}
%TODO: add a proof of associativity? (Likely not necessary.)

\subsection{Defining a meta-group}

To make the above definition more concrete, we will go through the process of
defining a meta-group, which is a generalization of a group object.
Traditionally, the data of a group object are the following:
\begin{itemize}
        \item An object $G$ in a category $\CC$.
        \item A morphism $\map {\mult} {G\times G} {G}$ called
                \enquote{multiplication}.
        \item A \enquote{unit} morphism
                $\map {\unit} {\set{1}} {G}$.\footnote{When $\CC = \Set$, we
                usually write the unit as an element $1=\unit(1)\in G$
        }
        \item An \enquote{inversion} morphism $\map {\antipode} {G} {G}$.
        \item A collection of relations between the morphisms, written as
                equalities of morphisms between Cartesian powers of $G$. For
                example, associativity may be written:
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:cd_assoc}
                \begin{tikzcd}
                        G\times G\times G
                                \rar["\mult \times \id"]
                                \dar["\id \times\mult"']
                        &G \times G
                                \dar["\mult"] \\
                        G \times G
                                \rar["\mult"']
                        &G
                \end{tikzcd}
                \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Further, the data of these relations is extended to higher powers of $G$ by
acting on other components by the identity:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:extend_group_identity}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
        G^{n+3}
                \rar["\mult \times \id^{n+1}"]
                \dar["\id \times\mult\times \id^{n}"']
        &G^{n+2}
                \dar["\mult\times \id^{n}"] \\
        G^{n+2}
                \rar["\mult\times \id^{n}"']
        &G^{n+1}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

Let us alter how we package these data so as to maximize the clarity of the
meta-group structure:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Instead of linear orders of factors $G \times \dots \times G$, we
                will index factors by a finite set $S$, writing it $G_S \defeq
                \set{\map {f} {S} {G}}$ in the style of
                \cref{eq:indexed_tensor}.
        \item The indexed factors will determine how the group operations act.
                For instance, multiplication of factor $i$ and $j$ together,
                with the result labelled in factor $k$ is to be written
                $\map {\mult^{ij}_{k}} {G_{\set{i,j}}} {G_{\set{k}}}$.
        \item Instead of implicitly including extensions of morphisms to higher
                powers by the identity, we will parametrize the extension by
                finite sets. For example, multiplication $\map {\mult^{ij}_{k}}
                {G_{\set{i,j}}} {G_{\set{k}}}$ generates a family of maps
                $\map {\mult^{ij}_k[S]} {G_{\set{i,j}\sqcup S}}
                {G_{\set{k}\sqcup S}}$, each of which must satisfy the relations
                of the group object such as \cref{eq:extend_group_identity}.
\end{enumerate}
This way of packaging the data leads us to a direct generalization: a
\defi{meta-group}-object in $\CC$ is a collection of objects $G_S\in \CC$
indexed by finite sets $S$, together with 
\begin{itemize}
        \item A family of objects $G_S\in \CC$, indexed over finite sets $S$.
        \item A family of morphisms $\map {\mult^{ij}_{k}[S]} {G_{\set{i,j}\sqcup S}}
                {G_{\set{k}\sqcup S}}$ called \enquote{multiplication}.
        \item A family of \enquote{unit} morphisms
                $\map {\unit_{i}[S]} {G_S} {G_{\set{i}\sqcup S}}$.
        \item An family of \enquote{inversion} morphisms $\map {\antipode^{i}_{j}[S]}
                {G_{\set{i}\sqcup S}} {G_{\set{j}\sqcup S}}$.
        \item A collection of relations between the morphisms, written as
                equalities of morphisms between the $G_X$'s. For
                example, associativity may be written:
                \begin{equation}
                \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=huge]
                        G_{\set{1,2,3}\sqcup S}
                                \rar["\mult^{1,2}_{1}\bk*{S\sqcup\set{3}}"]
                                \dar["\mult^{2,3}_{2}\bk*{S\sqcup\set{1}}"']
                        &G_{\set{1,3}\sqcup S}
                                \dar["\mult^{1,3}_{1}\bk{S}"] \\
                        G_{\set{1,2}\sqcup S}
                                \rar["\mult^{1,2}_{1}\bk{S}"']
                        &G_{\set{1}\sqcup S}
                \end{tikzcd}
                \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
We obtain traditional objects by further requiring that each family of morphisms
$ϕ[S]$ satisfy $ϕ[S] = ϕ\bk{\emptyset} \times \id_S$. 

Several examples of well-known algebraic structures presented as meta-objects
are given in \cref{sec:alg_defs}.

\section{Algebraic definitions}\label{sec:alg_defs}

We now introduce the algebraic structures which will be used to define the
tangle invariant. These definitions follow those given by Majid in \cite{SM},
although the ones presented below are given in a way that their corresponding
meta-structure is readily visible.

\begin{definition}[algebra]
        A \defi{algebra} is an object $A\in\CC$ together with an associative
        multiplication $\map {\mult^{i,j}_{k}} {A_{\set{i,j}}}
        {A_{\set{k}}}$ (satisfying \cref{eq:cd_mult}), and a unit
        $\map{\unit_{i}}{A_{\emptyset}}{A_{\set{i}}}$ satisfying
        \cref{eq:cd_unit}.\footnote{
                When $\CC = \Vect$, this is becomes the more familiar definition
                of an \defi{algebra}. When $A_\emptyset$ is a field, and it is
                more common think of the unit as an element $\one\in A$. The
                unit map is then defined by linearly extending the assignment
                $\unit_{i}(1) = \one_{i}$.
        }
\end{definition}

\begin{multicols}{2}\noindent
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cd_mult}
\begin{tikzcd}
        A_{\set{1,2,3}}
                \rar["\mult^{1,2}_{1}"]
                \dar["\mult^{2,3}_{2}"']
        &A_{\set{1,3}}
                \dar["\mult^{1,3}_{1}"] \\
        A_{\set{1,2}}
                \rar["\mult^{1,2}_{1}"']
        &A_{\set{1}}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\columnbreak
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cd_unit}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
        A_{\set{1}}
                \rar["\unit_{2}"]
                \drar["\id"']
        &A_{\set{1,2}}
                \dar["\mult^{1,2}_{1}", shift left]
                \dar["\mult^{2,1}_{1}"', shift right] \\
        &A_{\set{1}}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{multicols}

\begin{remark}
        From now on, we will denote repeated multiplication as in
        \cref{eq:cd_mult} by using extra indices. For instance:
        $\mult^{i,j, k}_{\ell} \defeq \mult^{i,j}_{r}\then\mult^{r, k}_{\ell}
        = \mult^{j, k}_{s}\then\mult^{i, s}_{\ell}$.
\end{remark}

There is also the dual notion of a \emph{coalgebra}, which arises by reversing
the arrows in \cref{eq:cd_mult,eq:cd_unit}:

\begin{definition}[coalgebra]
        A \defi{colagebra} is a vector space $C$ over a field $\K$ with a
        \defi{comultiplication} $\map {\comult} {C} {C\otimes C}$ which is
        \defi{coassociative} \eqref{eq:cd_comult} and a \defi{counit}, which is
        a map $\counit\colon A\to k$ satisfying \eqref{eq:cd_counit}.
\end{definition}
\nopagebreak
\begin{multicols}{2}\noindent

        C_{\set{1,2}}
                \uar["\comult^{2}_{2,3}"]
        &C_{\set{1}}
                \lar["\comult^{1}_{1,2}"]
                \uar["\comult^{1}_{1,3}"']

\begin{remark}
        From now on, we will denote repeated comultiplication as in
        \cref{eq:cd_comult} by using extra indices. For instance:
        $\comult^{i}_{j, k, \ell}
        \defeq \comult^{i}_{j,r}\then\comult^{r}_{k, \ell}
        = \comult^{i}_{s,\ell}\then\comult^{s}_{j, j}$.

If a vector space $B$ satisfies both definitions of an algebra and a coalgebra,
we introduce a definition for when the structures are compatible with each other
in the following way:

\begin{definition}[bialgebra]
        A \defi{bialgebra} is an algebra $(B,\mult,\unit)$ and a coalgebra
        $(B,\comult,\counit)$, such that $\comult$ and $\counit$ are algebra
        morphisms.\footnote{
                $B^{\otimes n}$ inherits a (co)algebra structure
                from $B$, given by
                component-wise operations. For instance, in the case of
                multiplication, this
                means $\mult\pn[\big]{(a_1\otimes b_1) \otimes (a_2 \otimes
                b_2)} = a_1a_2 \otimes b_1 b_2$. The bialgebra structure on
                $B_{\emptyset}$ is given by
                $\mult = \unit = \comult = \counit = \id$.
        }
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
        The conditions for $\comult$ being an algebra morphism are presented in
        \cref{eq:cd_mult_comult,eq:cd_unit_comult}, while those for $\counit$
        are in \cref{eq:cd_mult_counit,eq:cd_unit_counit}.\footnote{While
        notation explicitly naming each tensor factor appears cumbersome in
        these diagrams, it will prove invaluable later when used on tangle
        diagrams, so we leave it as is for the sake of consistency.} Observing
        invariance under arrow reversal, it may not come as a surprise that
        \cref{eq:cd_mult_comult,eq:cd_mult_counit} also are the conditions for
        $\mult$ being a coalgebra morphism, and
        \cref{eq:cd_unit_comult,eq:cd_unit_counit} tell us that $\unit$ is as
        well.

Finally, we introduce the invertibility condition we would expect on a quantum
group.
\begin{definition}[Hopf algebra]
A \defi{Hopf algebra} is a bialgebra $H$ together with a map $\map {\antipode} {H}
{H}$ called the \defi{antipode}, which satisfies for all $h\in H$,
$\comult^{1}_{1,2}\then \antipode^1_1 \then \mult^{1,2}_1 =
\counit^{1}\then\unit_{1} = 
\comult^{1}_{1,2}\then \antipode^2_2 \then \mult^{1,2}_1$.
As a commutative diagram, this looks like \cref{eq:cd_antipode}
\begin{equation}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=tiny]\label{eq:cd_antipode}
        H_{\set{1}}
                \arrow[rr, "\counit^{1}"] \arrow[rd, "\comult^{1}_{1,2}"']
        && H_{\emptyset}
                \arrow[rr, "\unit_{1}"]
        && H_{\set{1}} \\
        & H_{\set{1,2}}
                \arrow[rr, "\antipode^{2}_{2}", shift left]
                \arrow[rr, "\antipode^{1}_{1}"', shift right]
        && H_{\set{1,2}} \arrow[ru, "\mult^{1,2}_{1}"']
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

In order to do knot theory, we need an algebraic way to represent a crossing of
two strands. This is accomplished by the so-called $\Rmat$-matrix:

\begin{definition}[quasitriangular Hopf algebra]
A \defi{quasitriangular Hopf algebra} is a Hopf algebra $H$, together with an
invertible element $\Rmat \in H\otimes H$, called the \defi{$\Rmat$-matrix},
which satisfies the following properties: (we will denote the inverse by
$\Rmati$)
\begin{align}
        \label{eq:Rmat_overstrand}
        \Rmat_{12}\then\comult^{2}_{23}&=\Rmat_{a2}\Rmat_{b3}\then\mult^{ab}_1\\
        \label{eq:Rmat_understrand}
        \Rmat_{13}\then\comult^{1}_{12}&=\Rmat_{1b}\Rmat_{2a}\then\mult^{ab}_3\\
        \label{eq:Rmat_comult}
        \comult^{1}_{21} &= 
                \comult^{1}_{12} \Rmat_{1_i,2_i}\Rmati_{1_f,2_f}\then
                \mult^{1_i,1,1_f}_{1}\then \mult^{2_i,2,2_f}_{2}
\end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Drinfeld element]
        In a quasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$, the \defi{Drinfeld element},
        $\dfe \in H$ is given by:
        \begin{equation}
                \dfe \defeq \Rmat_{21}\then\antipode^2_2 \then \mult^{12}
        \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[monodromy]
        The \defi{monodromy}
        $\monodromy_{12} \defeq
        \Rmat_{12}\Rmat_{34}\then\mult^{14}_{1}\then\mult^{23}_{2}$. It's
        inverse will be denoted
        $\invb\monodromy =
        \Rmati_{12}\Rmati_{34}\then\mult^{14}_{1}\then\mult^{23}_{2}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
        The Drinfeld element $\dfe$ satisfies for all $h\in H$:
        \begin{align}
                \dfe_{1}h_2\dfe_{3} \then \mult^{1,2,3}
                &= h \then S \then S\\
                \dfe \then \comult_{12} 
                &= \dfe_1\dfe_2\invb\monodromy_{34}
                \then\mult^{13}_{1}\then\mult^{24}_2
        \end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
        See \cite{SM} or \cite{ES} %or an original reference?
        for more details on this standard result. Note that the proof does not
        rely on the additive structure of the Hopf algebra, which allows us to
        extend this result to the realm of meta-Hopf algebras.
        %TODO: finish
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[ribbon Hopf algebra]
        A quasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$ is called \defi{ribbon} if it has an
        element $\ribbon\in \centre(H)$ such that:
        \begin{align}
                \ribbon_1\ribbon_2\then\mult^{12}
                &= \dfe_1 \dfe_2 \then \antipode^{2}_{2} \then \mult^{12}\\
                \ribbon_1 \then \comult^1_{12}
                &=      \ribbon_1\ribbon_2
                        \then\invb\monodromy_{34}
                        \then\mult^{13}_{1}
                        \then\mult^{24}_{2} \\
                \ribbon \then \antipode &= \ribbon\\
                \ribbon \then \counit &= \unit \then \counit = 1
        \end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[distinguished grouplike element (spinner)]
        A \defi{distinguished grouplike element} (or \defi{spinner}) in a
        quasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$ is an invertible element $\spin\in H$
        (with inverse $\invb\spin$) such that for all $x\in H$:
        \begin{align}
                \label{eq:spinner_ribbon}
                \spin_1\ribbon_2\spin_3 \then \antipode^2_2 \then \mult^{123} &=
                \ribbon\\
                \label{eq:spinner_comult}
                \spin_1\then\comult^{1}_{12} &=\spin_1\spin_2\\
                \label{eq:spinner_antipode}
                \spin \then\antipode &= \invb\spin\\
                \label{eq:spinner_conjugate}
                \spin_{1}x_2\invb\spin_{3}\then\mult^{1,2,3} &=
                x \then \antipode \then \antipode\\
                \label{eq:spinner_counit}
                \spin \then \counit &= \unit \then \counit = 1
        \end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[spinners and ribbon Hopf algebras]\label{lem:spinner_ribbon}
        If a Hopf algebra has either a ribbon element $\ribbon$ or a spinner
        $\spin$, then it must have the other as well, given by the formula:
        $\spin_1 \ribbon_2 \then \mult^{12} = \dfe$.
\end{lemma}

Both the ribbon and the spinner element relevant have topological
interpretations in the context of tangles, which are outlined in
\cref{sec:topological_interpretations}.

% TODO:

\begin{remark}
        By insisting that the ends of all strands in the diagram point up, and
        that only upward-pointing portions of strands participate in crossings,
        we may replace the (co)evaluation operations with the \enquote{spinner}
        element (also called the distinguished grouplike element), derived from
        the ribbon element and the Drinfeld element.
\end{remark}
In \cite{BV}, Bar-Natan and Van der Veen define an invariant of tangles valued
in tensor powers of a certain Hopf algebra $\CU$. Their work expresses the
algebra operations as perturbed Gaußian generating functions so as to produce a
strong polynomial-time tangle invariant.
