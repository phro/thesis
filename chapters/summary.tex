\section{Algebraic tools for understanding knots}
\subsection{Knotted objects}
In the field of knot theory, distinguishing between two knots or links
has proven to be a difficult task. Computing strong invariants of knotted
objects is a popular way to aid with the classification of these objects.

        \label{fig:unknot}
\end{figure}

Merely being able to distinguish between two knotted objects does not always
provide us with enough information about these topological structures. For
instance, one may ask if a link is a \emph{satellite} (i.e. whether its
complement has a non-trivial embedding of a torus), whether a knot is
\emph{slice} (i.e. it is the boundary of a disk in $\R^4$), or whether it is
\emph{ribbon} (i.e. it is the boundary of a disk in $\R^3$ with restricted types
of singularities). (For more details see, for instance, Lickorish's
\cite{lickorish}.) Many interesting properties of knots can be phrased in terms
of certain topological operations, such as strand doubling (taking a strand and
replacing it with two copies of itself, as in \cref{fig:strand_double}) or
strand stitching (joining two open components together to form one longer one).

\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics{figures/tangle_comult.pdf}
        \caption{An example of strand-doubling.}
        \label{fig:strand_double}
\end{figure}

Open problems such as the Ribbon Slice Conjecture (asking whether there exists a
slice knot which is not ribbon, posed by R.\@ H.\@ Fox \cite{fox}) may be
advanced by the development of \enquote{topologically aware} invariants---those
which preserve topological data in a retrievable way.

\subsection{Quantum invariants}

One such class of topological invariants is derived from quasitriangular Hopf
algebras, which are algebraic structures whose operations mimic those of knotted
objects. In this approach, one takes a knotted object and decomposes it into a
sequence of topological operations (such as stitching strands or doubling
strands), then maps each of these operations to a corresponding algebraic
operation. The composition of these algebraic operations is the value of the
invariant.

More specifically, a Hopf algebra is an algebra $A$ together with several maps
between various tensor powers thereof (for instance, a comultiplication map
$\map {\comult} {A} {A \otimes A}$). Each crossing assigned an element of $A
\otimes A$. Tensor factors which belong to the same strand are concatenated by
multiplying the associated algebra elements. The value of the invariant is an
element of a tensor power of $A$. We go over this in more detail in
\cref{ch:intro}.

While this formulation is elegant, it has a notable drawback: computing the
invariant of a tangle with many components requires manipulating
large tensor powers of $A$. One remedy is to instead perform the computation in
a representation $V$ of $A$ with a low dimension, though the issue of
exponential growth in complexity remains. This limitation restricts the utility
of quantum invariants to smaller knots.

\section{Computational improvements using the universal invariant}
To avoid the issue of exponential computational complexity, one can instead
investigate the set of all values of the universal invariant (using the algebra
itself instead of a representation) as a subset of the algebra and its tensor
powers. For a particular choice of algebra (namely $\CUlong$, as investigated by
Dror Bar-Natan and Roland van der Veen in \cite{BV}) the space of values the
corresponding invariant $Z$ can take is significantly smaller than the whole
space; the rank of the space of values grows only quadratically with the number
of crossings in the knotted object. In particular, by looking at the generating
functions of the algebra operations, one sees that the value of $Z$ on tangles
always take the form of a (perturbed) Gaußian. Computationally, this means one
need only keep track of a quadratic form and a small perturbation. The invariant
$Z$ dominates the $\Sl_2$-coloured Jones polynomial. Here, we will focus on the
case when $ϵ=0$, for which $Z$ becomes an efficient computation of the Alexander
polynomial $Δ$ on knots. This topic is described in
\cref{ch:perturbed_gaussians}.

\section{Extending $Z$ to links}
The research program outlined by Bar-Natan and van der Veen computes $Z$
only for (open) tangles--that is, collections of open strands whose endpoints
are fixed to a boundary circle. (Note that this includes long knots, which are
exactly the one-component tangles.) This thesis is focused on extending $Z$ and
its computations to tangles with closed components.

        \label{fig:open_tangle}
\end{figure}

        \caption{A tangle with a closed component.}
        \label{fig:impure_tangle}
\end{figure}        

\subsection{Computing the extended map}
The first task is to determine the space in which the extended invariant, which
we will call $\ptr$, lives. One may observe that in a matrix algebra, one is
able to contract two matrices together via matrix multiplication. When one
wishes to contract a matrix along itself, one uses the trace map. Analogously,
since two strands in a tangle corresponds to multiplication, closing a strand
into a loop should correspond algebraically to a trace map.

In a generic algebra $A$, the trace map is defined as the projection onto the
set of coinvariants: $\map {\trace} {A} {A_A = A/\liebk{A}{A}}$.\footnote{Here,
$\liebk AA = \Span\setbuilder{\liebk{x}{y}}{x, y\in A}$ refers to the vector
space of Lie brackets, not the ideal generated thereby. The space $A_A$ does not
have an algebra structure in general.} In order to extend the invariant in this
framework, we must first compute the space of coinvariants for $\CUlong$, then
compute the coinvariants map, and write it as a generating function. (This is
accomplished in \cref{sec:coinv_comp}.)

\subsection{Performing computations}
Unfortunately, the resulting trace map does not take the form of a perturbed
Gaußian in a way that readily connects to the existing framework. In order to
determine whether further study in this direction is merited, we must find an
alternative computation method to get a preliminary sense of the strength of
$\ptr$.

For a subclass of links (which includes all two-component links), we compute an
explicit closed form for the trace map, then implement a computer program to
compute the value of $\ptr$ on all two-component links with up to $11$
crossings. When applied to knots, $Z$ computes the Alexander
polynomial. When applied to two-component
tangles, one may expect that $\ptr$ would produce the natural generalization to
multiple components: the \ac{MVA}. Surprisingly, the \ac{MVA} and $\ptr$ are
incomparable, with each being able to distinguish pairs of links the other
cannot. (See \cref{sec:compare_MVA} for more information.)

\subsection{Further study}
As $\ptr$ does not generalize $Z$ in the manner expected, several interesting
avenues of further research are opened. Firstly, determining what the
relationship between $\ptr$ and the \ac{MVA} remains open. Second is the
challenge of finding an efficient method for computing $\ptr$ on links with more
than two components, which currently is mired in complications with
the presence of non-elementary functions where quadratic forms normally appear.
Third is the question of the existence of other viable trace candidates. In
particular, it may be worth exploring whether a universal trace with respect to
the perturbed Gaußian framework defines a sufficiently useful invariant.
