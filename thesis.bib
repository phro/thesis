	abstract = {It is known that connected sum of two virtual knots is not uniquely determined and depends on knot diagrams and choosing the points to be connected. But different connected sums of the same virtual knots cannot be distinguished by Kauffman’s affine index polynomial. For any pair of virtual knots K and M with n-dwrithe ∇Jn(K)≠0 we construct an infinite family of different connected sums of K and M which can be distinguished by F-polynomials.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02057},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2109.02057},
	abstract = {We introduce a new approach to universal quantum knot invariants that emphasizes generating functions instead of generators and relations. All the relevant generating functions are shown to be perturbed Gaussians of the form \$Pe{\textasciicircum}G\$, where \$G\$ is quadratic and \$P\$ is a suitably restricted "perturbation". After developing a calculus for such Gaussians in general we focus on the rank one invariant \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{Z\}\_{\textbackslash}mathbb\{D\}\$ in detail. We discuss how it dominates the \${\textbackslash}mathfrak\{sl\}\_2\$-colored Jones polynomials and relates to knot genus and Whitehead doubling. In addition to being a strong knot invariant that behaves well under natural operations on tangles \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{Z\}\_{\textbackslash}mathbb\{D\}\$ is also computable in polynomial time in the crossing number of the knot. We provide a full implementation of the invariant and provide a table in an appendix.},

Based on the author's lecture notes from a Part {III} pure mathematics course at Cambridge University, it is suitable for use as a textbook for graduate courses in quantum groups or as a supplement to modern courses in advanced algebra. The book assumes a background knowledge of basic algebra and linear algebra. Some familiarity with semisimple Lie algebras would also be helpful. The book is aimed as a primer for mathematicians and takes a modern approach leading into knot theory, braided categories and noncommutative differential geometry. It should also be useful for mathematical physicists.},
