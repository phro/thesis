	abstract = {It is known that connected sum of two virtual knots is not uniquely determined and depends on knot diagrams and choosing the points to be connected. But different connected sums of the same virtual knots cannot be distinguished by Kauffman’s affine index polynomial. For any pair of virtual knots K and M with n-dwrithe ∇Jn(K)≠0 we construct an infinite family of different connected sums of K and M which can be distinguished by F-polynomials.},

Based on the author's lecture notes from a Part {III} pure mathematics course at Cambridge University, it is suitable for use as a textbook for graduate courses in quantum groups or as a supplement to modern courses in advanced algebra. The book assumes a background knowledge of basic algebra and linear algebra. Some familiarity with semisimple Lie algebras would also be helpful. The book is aimed as a primer for mathematicians and takes a modern approach leading into knot theory, braided categories and noncommutative differential geometry. It should also be useful for mathematical physicists.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new invariant of tangles along with an algebraic framework in which it is to be interpreted. We claim that the invariant contains the classical Alexander polynomial of knots and its multivariable extension to links. We argue that of the computationally efficient members of the family of Alexander invariants, it is the most meaningful.
